A screenshot program
-----------------

The main goal of this project is to make atool so that you can upload pictures just using a keystroke and selecting de area you actually want to upload, it will do the rest for you.

However, I will be using *Visual Basic* because I want to build it fast and with the few time I have, it's faster than using QT and technologies a-like.
